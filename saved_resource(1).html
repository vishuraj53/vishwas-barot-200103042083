    <p>MUMBAI: Responding to Uddhav Thackeray's statement that rebel Shiv Sena MLAs should face elections, CM Eknath Shinde said on Friday, without naming Thackeray, that he would quit politics if even a single one of 40 Sena MLAs who had backed him lost the next elections.
Uddhav had remarked earlier that the rebels would lose if they contested polls. Shinde said, "It is said that none of the rebel MLAs will be elected. But I say no MLA will lose. I have taken responsibility for this. If any of these men lose, I will leave politics." He added, "Also, who are you to decide who will win and who will lose? All this is decided by people. Voters decide."</p>

    <p>In retrospect, would Boris Berezovsky agree that the Russian privatisation scheme of the mid-1990s was unfair? The questioner had in mind the way a few insiders took over vast industrial assets for a song, a giant scam that helped discredit markets and democracy among their struggling compatriots. Absolutely it was unfair, replied Berezovsky, who in 2000 had sought refuge in Britain, where the exchange took place: Mikhail Khodorkovsky got more than he did..</p>

    <p>The war in Ukraine is a curious mix of old and new. Soldiers crouch in trenches that would not be out of place in Verdun, were it not for the glimpse of a reconnaissance drone above. Some Ukrainian gunners receive orders via Elon Musk’s Starlink constellation of satellites. Others fire artillery pieces that pre-date the Cuban missile crisis. Chinese-made quadcopters drop 1940s-vintage grenades on unsuspecting Russian tanks. It has the feel of a steampunk novel by Tom Clancy. Making sense of all this can be tricky. Conscription has ebbed away in America and most big European countries, so military matters seem rarefied. The Western wars of the past 30 years have been waged largely against assorted insurgents and guerrillas; the sound of big guns once more pounding out duels within Europe is disorienting. How to understand it all? .</p>
